## Testing Requirements

- Verify that these sections don't appear in the review page
- Verify that no empty section headers are shown

### Test Case 2: CV with Populated New Sections
- Upload a CV that has interests and certifications
- Verify that these sections appear correctly in the review page
- Verify that the data is displayed properly
