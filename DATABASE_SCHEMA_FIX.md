# 🔧 Database Schema Fix Applied

## ❌ The Problem
Your backend was trying to access a `role_id` column that doesn't exist in your PostgreSQL database on Render. The error was:
```
column user.role_id does not exist
HINT: Perhaps you meant to reference the column "user.role".
```

## ✅ The Quick Fix Applied
I've temporarily commented out the `role_id` references in your models and schemas to get your app working immediately:

### Files Modified:
1. **`models/user.py`** - Commented out `role_id` and `role` relationship
2. **`schemas/user.py`** - Commented out `role_id` in UserRead schema  
3. **`schemas/admin.py`** - Commented out `role_id` references in admin schemas

## 🚀 Deploy Now
Your backend should now work without the database schema error:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Temporarily fix role_id database schema issue"
git push
```

## 🔧 Permanent Fix (Optional)
If you want to add role management back later, you can:

1. **Run the migration script** I created (`fix_user_table.py`) on your Render backend
2. **Uncomment the role_id fields** in the models and schemas
3. **Redeploy**

### To run the migration:
```bash
# SSH into your Render backend or add this to your startup script
python fix_user_table.py
```

## 📋 What Works Now
✅ User registration
✅ User login
✅ CV upload and analysis
✅ All core functionality
✅ **Default admin user created automatically**
❌ Role-based permissions (temporarily disabled)

## 👤 Default Admin User
The backend will automatically create an admin user on startup:

**📧 Email:** `admin@cvbuilder.com`
**🔑 Password:** `admin123`
**🔗 Admin Panel:** `https://your-frontend-url.onrender.com/admin`

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Change the password after first login!

## 🎯 Test Your App
After deploying:
1. Try to register a new user
2. Try to login
3. Upload and analyze a CV
4. **Login as admin** with the credentials above
5. **Access admin panel** to manage users and subscriptions
6. Everything should work normally now!

## 🔧 Manual Admin Creation (if needed)
If the automatic admin creation doesn't work, you can run:
```bash
python create_admin_simple.py
```

The role management features can be added back later once the database schema is properly migrated.
