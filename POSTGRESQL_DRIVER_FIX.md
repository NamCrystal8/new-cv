# PostgreSQL Driver Fix for Render Deployment

This guide explains how to fix the PostgreSQL driver issue when deploying to Render. The main issue was that the application was using `psycopg2` (synchronous driver) instead of `asyncpg` (asynchronous driver) for PostgreSQL connections in an asyncio context.

## The Solution

### 1. Fixed Database Configuration

We've updated the `database.py` file to properly handle different URL formats and ensure we're using the correct async drivers:

- For PostgreSQL: Using `asyncpg` driver
- For SQLite: Using `aiosqlite` driver
- For MySQL: Using `asyncmy` driver

The updated code properly converts `postgres://` URLs to `postgresql+asyncpg://` format.

### 2. Added Debug Endpoints

We've added a new debug endpoint at `/debug/database` that you can access to verify database connectivity:

```
https://your-render-app.onrender.com/debug/database
```

This endpoint will show connection status and driver information.

### 3. Database Testing Script

For debugging database issues directly on Render, you can run:

```bash
# Connect to your Render shell
$ python test_database.py
```

This script provides detailed diagnostics about your database connection.

## Steps to Deploy

1. **Push the Updated Code to Your Repository**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix PostgreSQL async driver issue"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Render**
   - Open your Render dashboard and navigate to your service
   - Click "Manual Deploy" > "Deploy latest commit"
   - Wait for the deployment to complete

3. **Verify the Deployment**
   - Visit the health check endpoint: `https://your-app.onrender.com/health`
   - Visit the database debug endpoint: `https://your-app.onrender.com/debug/database`

4. **Check Logs if Issues Persist**
   - In Render dashboard, click on your service 
   - Go to "Logs" tab to see any runtime errors

## Key Files Modified

1. `database.py` - Updated to correctly use async drivers
2. `migrations/env.py` - Fixed to handle async-to-sync URL conversion
3. `health_routes.py` - Added database debug endpoint
4. `requirements.txt` - Updated dependencies
5. `start.sh` - Added diagnostics
6. `build.sh` - Added dependency checks
7. `test_database.py` - Added diagnostics script

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"No module named 'asyncpg'"**
   - Make sure `asyncpg` is properly installed
   - Solution: `pip install asyncpg>=0.27.0`

2. **"RuntimeError: database queries cannot be run during startup"**
   - FastAPI is trying to use database connections during startup
   - Solution: Move database operations out of app startup events

3. **"TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable"**
   - This might indicate a malformed database URL
   - Solution: Check your DATABASE_URL environment variable format

4. **Connection timeouts**
   - Network issues between Render and your database
   - Solution: Check IP allowlisting in your database provider

Remember to use the database debug endpoint and test script to diagnose specific issues with your deployment.
